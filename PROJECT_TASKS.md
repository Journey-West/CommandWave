## Issues and Blockers
* 2025-04-11 21:10:40 EDT* - **Issue #1:** [T26: Create custom tmux theme] - Application correctly creates helper scripts to apply tmux theme but theme not showing in active sessions. Fixed by modifying the command sequence and using a shell script to properly source config files at terminal startup.
* 2025-04-11 22:38:12 EDT* - **Issue #2:** [T34: Standardize UI interactions] - Variable creation functionality not working due to JavaScript scope issue with "state is not defined" error. Fixed by moving functions within document ready scope.
* 2025-04-11 22:42:17 EDT* - **Issue #3:** [T36: Terminal creation] - Duplicate prompts appearing when creating new terminals because of conflicting browser prompt. Fixed by completely replacing all browser prompts with custom modal dialogs.
* 2025-04-11 23:18:52 EDT* - **Issue #4:** [T44: Variable inputs styling] - Variable input fields showing white background when filled with text, breaking the dark theme. Fixed by applying consistent background and adding yellow highlight for filled inputs.
