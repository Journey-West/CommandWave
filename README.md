## Overview

CommandWave provides a streamlined, web-based environment for managing multiple terminal sessions powered by `tmux` and `ttyd`. It features a distinct cyberpunk/neon aesthetic and allows users to work with Markdown-based "playbooks" containing executable code blocks. Define variables, search through local playbooks, and execute commands directly into your active terminal session, enhancing command-line workflows.

## Features

* **Multi-Tab Terminal Management**: Create, name, switch between, and close multiple `tmux`-backed terminal sessions via `ttyd`.

* **Markdown Playbook Integration**:
    * Upload Markdown (`.md`) files as playbooks.
    * Create new playbooks directly within the application.
    * Playbooks are parsed to separate text blocks from code blocks.
    * Cross-reference between playbooks using special syntax.
    * Playbooks synchronize across sessions and clients automatically.
    * Edit code blocks directly within the interface.

* **Executable Code Blocks**: Execute shell command blocks from playbooks directly into the active terminal session.

* **Variable Substitution**: 
    * Define variables with user-friendly titles and reference names (supports spaces in Variable Names).
    * Use the intuitive "Add Variable" modal interface.
    * Variables are automatically substituted into code blocks before execution.
    * Variables persist and synchronize across browser sessions and devices.

* **Synchronization and Collaboration**:
    * Terminal tabs, playbooks, and variables sync across all connected sessions.
    * Real-time presence indicators show other connected users.
    * Changes made in one browser window reflect in all others in real-time.
    * All user data persists between browser sessions.

* **Playbook Search**: Quickly search across all loaded playbooks for specific commands or text.

* **Theme Selection**:
    * Switch between the default cyberpunk dark theme, neon light theme, and witch hazel theme.
    * Theme preference is saved in the browser and will persist between sessions.
    * Terminal areas remain dark in all themes for optimal readability.

* **Enhanced Code Readability**:
    * Syntax highlighting with cyberpunk-style neon colors.
    * Specially enhanced visibility for command names and arguments.
    * Common pentesting tools and commands highlighted for better readability.

* **Persistent Notes**:
    * A global notes panel for general information.
    * A separate notes panel for each terminal tab. Notes are saved automatically.

* **Error Handling**: Dedicated error modals with clear messages for various error conditions.

* **Cyberpunk UI**: A visually distinct interface inspired by neon and cyberpunk aesthetics, including a matching `tmux` theme option.

* **Custom tmux Theming**: Includes an optional, enhanced `tmux` configuration file (`commandwave_theme.tmux.conf`) for a cohesive visual experience.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* Flask 2.3.3 and other Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`):
  * Werkzeug
  * Jinja2
  * Markdown
  * Pygments
  * Flask-SocketIO
* **`ttyd`**: A command-line tool for sharing terminals over the web.
    * *Installation*: Download binaries or build from source via the [official ttyd GitHub repository](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd).
* **`tmux`**: A terminal multiplexer.
    * *Installation*: Typically available via system package managers (e.g., `sudo apt install tmux`, `brew install tmux`).

## Installation

1. **Install System Dependencies**: Ensure `ttyd` and `tmux` are installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

   **For Debian/Ubuntu:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install tmux
   ```
   
   For `ttyd`, download from the [official GitHub releases](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd/releases) or build from source.

   **For macOS:**
   ```bash
   brew install tmux
   brew install ttyd
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Journey-West/CommandWave
   cd CommandWave
   ```

3. **Set Up a Python Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running CommandWave

1. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd CommandWave
   ```

2. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --use-default-tmux-config
   ```

3. **Access the UI**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified if using the `--port` option).

### Command Line Options 

* `--port PORT`: Specify the port for the web server (default: 5000).
* `--use-default-tmux-config`: Apply the custom `commandwave_theme.tmux.conf` to the `tmux` sessions managed by CommandWave.
* `--hostname HOSTNAME`: Specify the hostname to use for terminal connections (default: localhost).
* `--remote`: Enable remote access by binding to all interfaces (use with caution).

## Usage Guide

1. **Terminals**:
   * The main terminal is available on launch.
   * Click the `+` button in the terminal tabs bar to create a new terminal session. You'll be prompted for a name.
   * Click on a tab to switch to that terminal.
   * Double-click a tab name (not the 'x') to rename it.
   * Click the `x` on a tab to close that terminal session.
   * Terminal tabs synchronize across all browser sessions connected to the same server.

2. **Theme Settings**:
   * Click the gear icon in the top right corner and select "Theme Settings" to open the theme modal.
   * Choose between "Cyberpunk Dark" (default), "Neon Light", and "Witch Hazel" themes.
   * Your selection is saved in the browser and will persist between sessions.

3. **Variables**:
   * Use the "Variables" section to define variables for use in your playbooks.
   * Click "+ Add Variable" to open the variable creation modal.
   * Each variable has two parts:
       * **Variable Title**: A user-friendly display name (can include spaces)
       * **Variable Reference**: The actual reference name used in code (no spaces allowed, automatically prefixed with $)
   * Example: Title "Target IP Address" with Reference "targetIp" would be used as `$targetIp` in code blocks.
   * Variables will be substituted when you click "Execute" on a code block.
   * Variables synchronize across browser sessions and persist between sessions.
   * The Variables section is collapsed by default when opening a new Terminal Tab.

4. **Playbooks**:
   * Click "Upload Playbook" to load `.md` files.
   * Click "Create Playbook" to author a new playbook within the app.
   * Playbooks appear in the section below the controls. Click the playbook title to expand/collapse its content.
   * To close a playbook, press and hold the "X" icon on the playbook header. This hold-to-close action ensures the playbook closes for all users in real-time while suppressing redundant sync events.
   * Within code blocks (` ``` `), click:
       * **Copy**: Copies the code (with variables substituted) to the clipboard.
       * **Execute**: Sends the code (with variables substituted) to the *currently active* terminal tab for execution.
       * **Edit**: Double-click on a code block to edit it. Press Ctrl+Enter or click the Save button to save changes.
   * Links within playbooks to other .md files will load those playbooks, while external links open in new tabs.
   * Create cross-references between playbooks using the syntax: `[Link Text](playbook:playbook_name.md)`.
   * Playbooks synchronize across browser sessions and persist between sessions.

5. **Search**:
   * Use the search bar to find lines within any loaded playbook's content.
   * Results show the filename, line number, and content. Click on a result to open that playbook.

6. **Notes**:
   * Click "Global Notes" or "Tab Notes" in the header to toggle the respective side panels.
   * Content is saved automatically as you type.
   * Notes persist between sessions.

7. **Error Handling**:
   * The application displays dedicated error modals with clear messages for various error conditions.
   * These modals include specific guidance on how to resolve common issues.
