# CommandWave GitHub Pages Structure

This directory hosts the static website for the CommandWave project (served via GitHub Pages).

## Structure

- `index.html` — Main landing page
- `images/` — Site images and screenshots
- `css/` — Global and theme stylesheets
- `css/themes/` — Theme-specific CSS files
- `js/` — Main JS entry point
- `js/components/` — JS for interactive UI components (e.g., hero, terminal demo)
- `partials/` — HTML partials for header, footer, etc.

## How to Use
- Edit or add new pages in this folder.
- Place all images in `images/`.
- Place reusable CSS in `css/` and theme files in `css/themes/`.
- Place all scripts in `js/` and break up by component if needed.
- Use partials for header/footer if you manually build or use a static site generator.
